# Analysis of Netflix data containing TV Shows and Movies data using SQL

## Overview:
This project utilises Netflix movies and shows database and solves some requirements using SQL - The db contains all TV Shows and Movies meta data on Netflix. Updated every month. The db includes tables like netflix_titles, brands_v2, finance, info_v2, reviews_v2, traffic_v2.


## Insights:
1) Netflix database contains more Movies than TV Shows where Movies make up almost 70% of the repository.
2) 9.4% of content doesnâ€™t have a country associated with it.
3) The top 3 directors with the most content on Netflix are Rajiv Chilaka, Raul Campos/ Jan Suter, Marcus Raboy with 19, 18 and 16 titles to their name respectively. While the top 2 directors last release was in 2018, Marcus Raboy had a release in 2020.
4) Majority of content was added to Netflix from year 2017 to 2021.
5) Most content was added in 2019 where the total content crossed 2000 that had 71% Movies and 29% TV shows.
6) Content with genres Dramas, Documentaries, Comedies, are the most content added to Netflix, while content with International Movies, Children & Family Movies are the fastest growing.

## Recommendations:
1) Netflix should enrich the data by adding contry name for the 10% content missing country names, as it would help target audiences for those countries.
2) Seems the COVID pandemic resulted in Netflix adding more content in 2019
3) International Movies, Children & Family Movies are growing genres that can help viewership growth along with more popular content on Dramas, Documentaries, and Comedies.
